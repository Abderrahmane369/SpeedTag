## Game Overview

In Speed Tag, two players compete in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse across diverse, challenging maps. The game tests players' reflexes, strategic thinking, and mastery of advanced movement techniques, all brought to life with the robust capabilities of Phaser 3.

## Map Creation

I've developed a custom map maker specifically for Speed Tag, allowing for the creation of unique and challenging environments. This tool will be made available to the community when I publish the game's repository, enabling players to design and share their own maps.

## Development

Speed Tag was created using a Phaser 3 template, providing a solid foundation for rapid development and easy expansion. I'm actively working on enhancing the game, with online multiplayer support being my next major milestone.

Stay tuned for updates on the public release of my game repository, which will include the map maker tool and the core game code!
